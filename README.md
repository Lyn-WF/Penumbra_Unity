# Penumbra_Unity
A combat engine for a game inspired by Darkest Dungeon and Into the Breach, made in Unity

This game was made for the CIS: 4820 Game Programming course in University of Guelph, wherein it recieved a 100% grade.

I plan to continue development of this game, but will be doing so in the Godot engine as a matter of preference.
The porting of the game to Godot will also serve as a chance to reengineer much of the code responsible for
controlling the flow of combat, as much of it was designed for demo purposes and does not always follow the
practices I'd wish to employ for a long-term codebase.
